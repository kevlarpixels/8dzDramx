        <p>8dz dram@x is comprised of Danny, Ben, Chris, Kevin, and grid2bot. Stuck in a time warp, the quintet try to
            emulate the thought process of graphics and story-lines in the niche areas of the 80's and 90's through
            their
            music. Creating a soundtrack for something that hasn't happened yet.</p>

            together ranging from many types of music. They found their home in 8dz dram@x. The duo picked up Kevin
